<h1 style="font-size: 40px;font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;text-align: center;">Five memorable scenes featuring the actor</h1>
<h2 style="font-size: 30px;font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;">1. Pachalam Bhasi from 'Udayanaanu Thaaram'</h2>

<iframe width="905" height="498"  src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PNIdreeRM4E" title="Udayananu Tharam Movie Scenes | Jagathy Sreekumar trains Sreenivasan on Navarasas | Mohanlal" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p style="font-size:25px ; font-family: 'Gill Sans', 'Gill Sans MT', Calibri, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;" >One of the most loved Jagathy Sreekumar character ever. The actor played Pachalam Bhasi, an acting trainer in the movie. The trainer thinks himself as a great teacher, however, his acting tutions made the audience laugh. The character also did an invention in the movie. As there are 'Nava Rasa,' the nine emotions in the performing art, the actor invented the tenth! Even though Bhasi isn't talented, he performs things according to logic. However, the character tends to fail on certain occasions due to his stupidity. The way the actor, Jagathy Sreekumar carried the character was appreciable. It is even impossible for the audience to think about someone else as Bhasi.

<h2 style="font-size: 30px;font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;">2. Kumbidi from 'Nandanam'</h2>
<iframe width="885" height="498" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ykCDGdx3_fc" title="Nandanam | Entry of Kumbidi | Mazhavil Manorama" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p style="font-size:25px ;font-family: 'Gill Sans', 'Gill Sans MT', Calibri, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;">Prithviraj Sukumaran's debut film, 'Nandanam' is still remembered for the three characters. One definitely is Balamani, then Manu and Kumbidi! Actor Jagathy Sreekumar played a fake godman in the film. The actor played Palarivattom Sasi, who becomes a preacher and kind of Godman for the family. As he is a fake person, his affection for woman and alcohol is clearly shown in the movie. In a particular incident where he was about to get caught by someone from the family, he adventurously appears in two places at the same time. This makes him 'Kumbidi.' The character was a good representation of many fake preachers and God-men who are present in today's society.</p>


<h2 style="font-size: 30px; font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;">3. Kadalas from 'Kabooliwala'</h2>
<iframe width="885" height="498" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EQqvbl-N7C0" title="Kabooliwala Malayalam Movie Comedy Scene |Jagathy &amp; Innocent | Amrita Online Movies" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p style="font-size: 25px;font-family: 'Gill Sans', 'Gill Sans MT', Calibri, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;">One of the best comedy duos in Malayalam cinema. Kannas and Kadalas, who made the audience laugh from the beginning of the movie, gave us two characters to remember forever in Malayalam cinema.Kannas and Kadalas are rag pickers who enjoy life to the fullest. Their lives take a turn when they meet Munna, who comes in search of his bugle that was stolen by them. Kannas and Kadalas are rag pickers who enjoy life to the fullest.Kannas and Kakalas, children of the street who collect unwanted things from people, were never far behind when it came to love.He succeeds in bringing Munna and Laila together by risking their lives, but in the end their love is worthless in the face of the weight of money. The two characters who made me laugh for so long are finally remembered with a heartache at the end.</p>

<h2 style="font-size: 30px;font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;">4. Appukuttan from 'Yodha'</h2>
<iframe width="885" height="498" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aMriu1O2Ybg" title="YODHA MALAYALAM MOVIE ALL COMEDY / MALAYALAM COMEDY / JEGATHI COMEDY" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p style="font-size: 25px;font-family: 'Gill Sans', 'Gill Sans MT', Calibri, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;">The Sangeeth Sivan-Santhosh Sivan combo film is one of the classic movies of all time. The movie also had one of the hit combinations of actors in it, Mohanlal and Jagathy Sreekumar. The movie had Mohanlal and Jagathy Sreekumar playing Ashokan and Appukuttan respectively. These characters were first cousins and as their parents, they always had a competition mentality in them. Even though the fights were lovable and cute, the whole film shows the competition. When a film has an excellent actor like Mohanlal, the opposite lead must be that good to balance the performance with him. Otherwise, the audience could feel the decline. But for an actor like Jagathy Sreekumar, it was really easy. He flawlessly became the Appukuttan in the film.</p>
<h2 style="font-size: 30px;font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;">5. Krishnavilasom Bhageerathan Pillai from 'Meesha Madhavan'</h2>
<iframe width="885" height="498" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3_Z_7X2mV1U" title="Meesamadhavan Malayalam Movie Best Scenepurushu Enne Anugrahikkanam" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p style="font-size: 25px;font-family: 'Gill Sans', 'Gill Sans MT', Calibri, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;">This Lal Jose film is one of the most favourite movies of all time for the M-Town audience. The movie revolved around a local thief, Madhavan, and his love interest Rukmini. Dileep and Kavya Madhavan played the lead roles. Actor Jagathy played Krishnavilasom Bhageerathan Pillai, who is the father of Rukmini. Bhageerathan Pillai never liked Madhavan as he was a thief and also because he was not in good terms with Madhavan. Bhageerathan Pillai has an extra-marital affair with a Jawan's wife, which Madhavan catches. This increases the hatred Bhageerathan Pillai had for him. Even though they aren't in good terms, the movie has portrayed it in a healthy and comic way.</p>
